StackStudio
===========

This is the StackStudio application; a web based console for managing
private and public clouds.

Getting Started
---------------

1. This application requires the StackCore back end, for cloud operations (coming soon)

2. We use Node.JS and Grunt for build and release steps.  You'll need to install Node and NPM, from:

    http://nodejs.org/#download

3. Install Grunt and dependencies, cd to the <tt>StackStudio</tt> directory and run NPM:

    `cd StackStudio`
    `npm install`

4. To launch a web server, you can run a task:

    `grunt run`

    (9000 is the default listening port)

5. Go to http://localhost:9000/ and you'll see the StackStudio Dashboard
