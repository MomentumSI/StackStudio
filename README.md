StackStudio
===========

This is the StackStudio application; a web based console for managing
private and public clouds.

Getting Started
---------------

1. This application requires the StackCore back end, for cloud operations (coming soon)

2. To launch, change directory to <tt>StackStudio</tt> and start the web server:
       <tt>cd StackStudio; bundle exec rackup -i . -p 8000</tt>
       (where 8000 is the listening port)

3. Go to http://localhost:8000/ and you'll see the StackStudio Dashboard
